From my perspective, patience is a good thing and we shoud take action after a while.

To begin with, take action at once may lead us to lose the chance to analyze things thoroughly. 
Secondly, patience can keep us calm. It is more likely to get into trouble when we try to take actions at once.
Last but not least, we may get other's advice when we try to wait for a while so that we can reach our goals more easily.



From my perspective, I agree with that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.
First of all, young people nowadays are busier and more stressed than in the past, which leaves them little time to helping their communities.
Secondly, with the development of modern technology, young people nowadays have more access to different entertainments. Many of them get addicted to numerous entertainments instead of helping their communities.
Last but not least, the relationship between people is not as close as it used to be. Many young people don't tend to help their communities.
